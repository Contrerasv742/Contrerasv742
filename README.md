# Interest

## Security

I am new to the field of cybersecurity but I have always found the field intriguing. I have very informal knowledge of the topic but I write in C/C++ primarily. My experience in these languages has taught me how to write memory-safe, maintainable, and scaleable code for use in large systems.

## Computer Networks

I have fallen in love with computer networks. I am currently conncentrated 

## NeoVim

I was introduced to vim in my first year of education. I dreaded it because I saw vim as a limited way of editing. Now I am a religious advocate of vim.

I use vim for anything and everything including: To create pdf assignments in markdown, code in C/C++, and even for math.

I love learning more about vim as it truly makes me a more efficient programmer as I can work effectively and quickly on any system no matter the OS or system hardware. It also enables me to say:

"I use Neovim btw"

## Ricing

I enjoy spending break time from my studies to improve my setup to be more effective. I maintain a config repo that contains a documentation and portable way to import my favorite system requirements to any new system. I currently primarily work in Windows but am working on creating a portable way to determine OS and install my configuration based on the system.

Tools:

***Tiling Manager:***
